# Tracking COVID-19 Cases Globally

This project inolves using data science techniques to construct a rate at which confirmed cases of COVID-19 are growing in various countries around the world.

## Goal

- **Part 1**: Construct a list of total COVID-19 cases by country with more than 1,000 cases
- **Part 2**: Fit the time series of confirmed cases in these countries using both an exponential and logistic function
- **Part 3**: Use the fit curves to infer doubling times (the amount of time it takes for cases to double)

This analysis is the first step in being able to effectively track the growth in cases around the globally and domestically, considering New York has become the latest hot spot for the pandemic.

## Data

This project primarily uses data from the John Hopkins University Data Repository, which tracks daily global cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to exposure from COVID-19.
